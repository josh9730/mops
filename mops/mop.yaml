  "Audit Lumen Bulk Panels":
    - rh: From previous remote hands work, some jumpers were likely not run as expected. This work is to audit and document these panels.
    - rh: There are two panels in C12.02 and two panels in C09.05. These were provided by Lumen, and the rear ports connect to the remote panels
    - rh: From the two panels in C12.02, provide a complete list of where each jumper terminates to. This will either be to the Cisco NX switch or Juniper MX router.
    - rh: The two panels in C09.05 will have to be traced in stages.
    - rh: Stage 1 - Trace the bulk panel cables. These will terminate on one of the modular panels designated 'HUB-'
    - rh: Stage 2 - Trace from the 'HUB-' panel. This can be done by 1) Identifying the front port number that faces the bulk panel (i.e. Port 1/2), 2) Tracing the MPO-24 in the rear of the panel to the remote rack and 3) Once the remote rack/panel is identified, trace from the same port number identified earlier
    - cmd_rh: 
      - Repeat the above until you reach a transponder card or other networking device. CENIC NOC can help with identifying the 'expected' jumper runs from our documentation
